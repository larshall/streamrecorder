StreamRecorder records rtp/h.264 multicast stream(s) from
a DVB device to disk.
The DVB stream is probably from dvblast, mumudvb or the likes.

To start recording from a multicast stream(s), you'll need a xmltv file.
See xmltv for further info: http://wiki.xmltv.org.

Start streamrecorder:
./streamrecorder -x <path to xmltv file> (default: './data/tv.xml dir')
For setting other options such as the http port, data dir etc, see the help.

Setting up a channel stream:
Point your browser to the streamrecorder's setup/settings page:
http://localhost:8182/settings.html (Default port is 8182).
Go to the settings page and select which channel the stream comes from.
Note: Channel names are extracted from the xmltv file.
Set the multicast address and port.
Save the channelstream.

Recording a programme:
Go to the recordings page http://localhost:8182/index.html, and
select which date and programme to record, and press 'record'.
